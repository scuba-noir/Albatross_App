                        <p>Albatross aims to connect the worldwide golf community to prestigious golf courses around the world in a way that has never been possible before. Our mission is to give our community members unprecedented utility at our partnered golf courses/resorts that otherwise would not be available. In partnership with prestigious golf courses, we plan to release NFT’s that will allow owners to participate in special events, enjoy exclusive discounts, benefit from early access to items, network with other community members and own unique digital pieces of art. We aim to foster a community of golf enthusiasts by giving them a platform to share their experiences, stories and passion with others.</p>
                        <p>We are the first project centered in bringing holders real life utility at top golf courses around the world through partnership. Albatross aims to connect the Web2 community to the Web3 community through golf. While owning an NFT might seem an unfamiliar concept to some consumers, we aim to make the process of ownership seamless for all. We plan to grow a community of golf enthusiasts that will enjoy perks and access to a network of top tier golf courses around the world.</p>
                        <p>Albatross NFT collections are not just another JPEG NFT project. The utility with courses, brands, and organizations are one of a kind in the market. The possibilities for owners are endless as Albatross will continue to expand to golf courses around the world and add utility to existing collections.</p>

                        <p>Golf courses/resorts have yet to take advantage of the opportunity to step into the digital world of NFTs. In doing so, courses and resorts are missing out on the opportunity to connect to golfers in an innovative fashion, increase brand recognition and offer a more unique experience. In partnership with Albatross, golf courses/resorts will reap the benefits of their hard work and labor without changing any major processes in place. The world's golf architects, designers and golf pros work endlessly to provide an experience unlike any other at their respective courses. Yet, as the staff works to provide a one of a kind physical experience for guests, they rarely can offer a unique digital interaction.</p>
                        <p>As transactions and experiences increasingly expand digitally everyday, there is an opportunity for golf courses/resorts to take advantage of their position and communities. Collaborative efforts between the courses/resorts and Albatross allows golfers to be more connected to courses than ever before. Furthermore, there is little interaction between courses/resorts to their guests off their property. Our community will be a place where courses/resort staff can gather feedback, ask questions and learn from customer experiences.</p>

                       <p>The worldwide golf community is in a great place. While the pandemic of COVID-19 was awful for most reasons, it had a positive impact on the amount of people wanting to play golf because of its natural elements. In the US in 2021 alone, the National Golf Foundation estimated 106 million people (one out of every three Americans age 6+) played golf (on or off-course), followed golf on television or online, read about the game, or listened to a golf related podcast. 2021 also holds the record for the most people who played golf on a physical golf course for the first time - 3.2 million people.</p>
                       <p>Furthermore, the category of young adults (18-34 year olds) held strong as golf’s biggest customer age segment, with 6.1 Million on-course participants and another 4.8 Million off-course only participants. This age demographic has consistently been the most active non-professional group of golfers over the last decade. In addition, 17.8 Million people who didn’t play golf in 2021 said they are "very interested" in playing golf on a golf course. That is almost a 20% increase in the pool of potential golfers over the past five years. It can be argued that golf is in the greatest state in its over 200 year lifetime with a constant influx of young golfers picking up the game.</p>

                        <p>Albatross estimates young adults (18-34 year olds) to be its primary community demographic as that age group is most affluent in the cryptocurrency community at the time of writing this whitepaper. However, one does not have to be knowledgeable about NFTs and cryptocurrency to own an Albatross NFT or be a part of the Albatross community. Albatross will bridge the gap for consumers who are new to the NFT space as they learn the benefits of owning an NFT with real world utility. Golf utility will be the connecting factor that brings consumers of all ages and crypto expertise levels. The NFTs serve as a vessel for these consumers to uniquely express themselves, show their admiration for the course/resort and connect with other community members. Maturity both in the NFT market and our community will continually foster an environment for first time or experienced NFT buyers. For this reason, Albatross community demographics will only grow with maturity day by day, project by project.</p>

                            <p>What’s amazing about building the Albatross community is that there is already a large community of golf enthusiasts out there. Golfers constantly rave about the amenities of their golf course whether it be perks in the clubhouse or the layout of their favorite hole. Golfers on social media, writers for magazines and journalists for golf publications capture the unique features of each course through pictures, articles and stories. Albatross will tap into this network of golf enthusiasts and be proactive in the community to make sure every member is heard and represented. Understanding what is most important to the community is something Albatross takes into account. Deciding on which courses Albatross should partner with, what utility is offered and what other benefits holders should get will largely be decided by the community through open forums and channels (primarily discord, instagram and twitter).</p>
                            <p>Albatross will also hold community specific golf tournaments and events around the world at partner courses. This will allow community members to play some of the greatest courses in the world with fellow community members. We truly will embrace bringing the URL to IRL with the game of golf.</p>

                            <p>The multiple partnerships of Albatross propel the community forward and drive value for holders and partners. This includes partnerships with our reputable (1) golf course photographer (TBD), (2) high quality brand partners and (3) golf courses/resorts.</p>

                                <p>As NFTs are often viewed as digital works of art, we want to provide owners the opportunity to own illustrious photographs from an acclaimed golf course photographer. (TBD)’s photographs are one of a kind digital pieces that capture beautiful holes, clubhouses and landscapes around our partner’s courses. Owning a unique digital photograph of theirs is valuable in its own right, but when it is paired with real world utility at the course, it brings the owners value above and beyond expectations.</p>

                                <p>Being an Albatross collection holder goes beyond the utility of having value at the course. Our brand partners will give owners the opportunity to enjoy exclusive discounts, gain access to the early release of goods, custom apparel and more. As Albatross matures in the golf and crypto community, we will continue to establish exclusive partnerships with top manufacturers, producers, influencers and more to provide value for our customers.</p>

Opportunities to expand and implement the process at other golf courses/resorts. Opportunities to partner with other NFT projects. Opportunities to partner with other brands and sponsors. Opportunities to get involved at a more professional level with the PGA Tour, professional golfers and worldwide leaders in the sport. Opportunities to apply our technology into other industries. A lot of this expansion will be driven by community ideas. When we say endless, we mean it! We will never stop innovating for and with our community.</p>

The recipient(s) of the money raised will be decided in collaboration with our golf course partners and the Albatross community.</p>
